Before installing the Doris Mobi Fitting Room app in your VTEX environment, you'll need to use the [VTEX IO Toolbelt (CLI)](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-install), and after its installation, proceed with the following steps:


1. To install the app, simply run the following command in your VTEX account:

```sh
vtex install codeby.dorismobi@0.3.18
```

Access the /apps route in the store's admin. In the list of installed apps, look for our app, which should be displayed as follows:

2. Go to the app's "Settings" and configure the following information according to your integration and store data:

- Public Api Key Doris;
- Private Api Key Doris;
- Opening cover: image to be used in the app's opening when clicking the button, for example:

    "props": {
      "preventVerticalStretch": true,
      "rowGap": 0
    },
    "children": [
      "flex-layout.row#product-name",
